["Eric Majersky: Hey. I am done packing and heading back to pittsburgh. When I came up here I was kind of intimidated because I am not used to moving to a new scene for a good while. I am glad you all were accepting and cool and fun to hang out with. I will miss all of you and especially to those who are graduating since I will see people in the fall who aren't haha. I am happy I got to meet you all and i hope I will see you guys soon. It's been real."]: 22
